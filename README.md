# Modeling a Snowflake's growth
This is a Python project for University 
The program shall display a snowflake obtained via an algorithm. It will be able to either show the final output or the progressive growth of the crystal

The generation of a crystal depends on a number of parameters. And obviously, different parameters produce different outcomes.
